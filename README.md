Style guide

Commenting code:  Block or line-by-line commenting are acceptable, as well as comments on the ends of lines so long as they are brief enough to remain on page.  Thorough commenting is encouraged anywhere that code may be unclear or confusing.

Indentation:  Source files in java should use tabs.  Web documents including html, css, and javascript source code should use 4-space indentation.

Repository:  Source files that are under active development should be committed to the Github repository on the develop branch.  The develop branch will be merged into the master branch at the end of each iteration.  Additional branches are allowed, but should have descriptive names and should be branched off of the develop branch or its child branches.  Commits should come with descriptive messages.

Testing:  Be prepared to test any code you want to commit to the develop branch.  If there is a reasonable possibility your commit will break the build and you cannot resolve or test for issues, consider committing on a new branch so we can merge once it is tested.

Object Oriented Programming:  To the extent possible, all code should adhere to SOLID principles of design.

Required technologies for deployment include JDK (1.8), Maven, MySQL (we have been using phpMyAdmin), Apache Mahout (0.12.2).  Further deployment information is available in the pom.xml file, which is used by Maven to track required packages.
